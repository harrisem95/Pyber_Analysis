# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this PyBer Analysis is to use bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, box-and-whisker plots, and pie charts to illustrate the information gathered in the analysis. We also practiced making these charts more beautiful and easy to understand through the use of formatting. Lastly, we calculated relevant statistics such as the mean, median, and mode to further understand the data. The purpose of this anaysis was to determine if there was a correlation between the fare, the number of rides, the number of drivers, and the city type.

## Results

### PyBer Analysis Results
* The rural cities had the lowest amount of rides and drivers, but the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The urban cities had the largest total amount of rides and drivers, but the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Although the fares were lower for the urban cities, because of the total number of rides exceeded the rural and suburban areas by a significant amount, the total fares were much higher. The urban city also had a significantly higher amoiunt of drivers than rides, causing them to earn a much lower fare per ride.

### PyBer Analysis Business Proposal
I would recommend that the CEO advertise their services in the Urban areas as there are a significant amount more drivers than rides. Since we have the supply for these rides, we just need to increase the demand. I would also recommend looking into the average distance travelled per ride per city type. This would be interesting as maybe this is the reason the fares are higher in the rural and suburban areas as those travellers are going a longer distance than the urban travellers. Lastly, I would increase the number of drivers in the suburban and rural areas. I would conduct further analysis to determine how many drivers I would need to hire for each city type, but looking at the data that we do have, it is clear that these areas are underserved.
